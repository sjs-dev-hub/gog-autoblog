### Today’s Topics

#### Irons & Wedges

**gap wedge 50.** When shopping for a 50-degree gap wedge, it's essential to consider its role in bridging the distance between your pitching wedge and sand wedge. This club is particularly beneficial for executing precise shots from 100-120 yards, improving your short game versatility. Key specifications to evaluate include loft, bounce, and club length, as these factors influence performance on different surfaces.

Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or price, rather than how the wedge feels during play. Aim for options like a standard gap wedge with a traditional blade design or a more forgiving cavity-back model, depending on your skill level and playing style.

**

_What to compare:_
- **
- Loft and bounce characteristics
- Clubhead design (blade vs. cavity back)
- Shaft options (length, flex, material)
