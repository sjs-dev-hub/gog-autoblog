High MOI drivers are designed to minimize twisting at impact, helping you achieve straighter shots even when your swing isn’t perfect. Look for specifications such as weight distribution, face design, and adjustable features that can enhance your performance. Common types include adjustable drivers that allow you to customize loft and lie angles or oversized models that provide a larger sweet spot.
