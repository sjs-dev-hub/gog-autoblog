This club fills the yardage gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, typically covering distances around 100-120 yards. Look for wedges with a variety of bounce angles to suit different turf conditions, as this affects how the club interacts with the ground.

Avoid common mistakes such as focusing solely on aesthetics or pricing; instead, prioritize functionality and fit with your playing style. Consider options like cavity-back wedges for forgiveness or blade-style wedges for enhanced control and feel.

Raw wedges, known for their uncoated finish, provide increased spin and improved feel around the greens. When selecting the right wedge, focus on loft options, bounce angle, and grind types to match your playing style and course conditions. Common types to explore include a classic blade wedge for precision shots and a cavity-back design for added forgiveness.

Avoid common mistakes such as choosing the wrong loft for your gap, overlooking the importance of bounce, or selecting a material that doesn't suit your playing environment.
