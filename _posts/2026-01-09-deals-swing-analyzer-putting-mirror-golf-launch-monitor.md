### Gear Insights

#### Training & Tech

#### Irons & Wedges

**players distance irons** — When shopping for players distance irons, it’s essential to understand their design and intended benefits. These clubs combine the control and precision of traditional irons with the forgiveness and distance associated with game improvement models. Look for features like a hollow body construction, which can enhance ball speed, and a low center of gravity for improved launch angles. Common mistakes include prioritizing aesthetics over performance and buying based solely on recommendations without testing the clubs yourself.

For example, consider exploring models labeled as "hollow body irons" or "distance-enhanced cavity backs" for optimal performance.

**gap wedge 50** — Shopping for a 50-degree gap wedge can elevate your short game by providing the versatility needed for approach shots and delicate chips around the green. When selecting a gap wedge, consider the loft, weight, and the type of sole grind, as these factors can influence your shot-making ability. A wedge with a wider sole can help prevent digging into the turf, while a heavier head might provide more control.

Common mistakes include neglecting to try different shaft lengths and flex options, which can affect your swing dynamics. Always assess the bounce angle, as it can impact performance on various turf conditions.

Common types of raw wedges include a standard pitching wedge and a specialty lob wedge designed for short shots around the green. 

Avoid common mistakes such as selecting a wedge solely based on looks or neglecting to match it to your existing set. A well-chosen raw wedge can significantly enhance your short game.

These balls are designed with a core for distance, an outer layer for soft feel, and a cover that enhances spin.
