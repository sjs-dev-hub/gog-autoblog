### Today’s Topics

#### Drivers by Budget

**draw bias driver.** When shopping for a draw bias driver, consider how its design can help correct a slice and promote a straighter ball flight. Look for adjustable features that allow for customization of loft and lie angles, which can enhance your performance based on your swing. Pay attention to the clubhead size and weight distribution, as a larger face can provide a larger sweet spot, while specific weight placements can encourage a draw. One common mistake is selecting a driver solely based on aesthetics rather than performance specs. 

Examples of generic product types include adjustable draw bias drivers with lightweight graphite shafts and high-MOI (Moment of Inertia) designs.

**driver under $300.** When shopping for a driver under $300, it's essential to consider your skill level and playing style. Look for a driver that offers a good balance of distance and forgiveness, as this can significantly impact your game. Pay attention to specifications like loft angle, clubhead size, and shaft flexibility, which can influence your swing dynamics. Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or being swayed by brand popularity instead of performance metrics.

For example, a titanium driver with a larger clubhead can provide a larger sweet spot, enhancing forgiveness. Alternatively, a composite driver may offer a lighter feel, promoting faster swing speeds.

When evaluating options, consider the weight distribution and design features that contribute to a higher MOI, such as a larger clubhead and perimeter weighting. Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or price rather than performance. Look for drivers with adjustable features, which allow customization for swing characteristics. Popular types of high MOI drivers include those with oversized heads and models featuring advanced materials for reduced twist during impact.

A well-fitted driver can significantly enhance your distance and accuracy, making it essential to assess specs like loft, shaft flex, and head size.
