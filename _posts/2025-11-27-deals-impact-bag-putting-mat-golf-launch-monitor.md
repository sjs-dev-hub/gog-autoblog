#### Irons & Wedges

**raw wedge.** When shopping for a raw wedge, it’s important to focus on factors that enhance your short game performance. Raw wedges, typically made from softer materials, provide better spin and control, especially around the greens. Look for specifications such as loft options (usually ranging from 48 to 60 degrees) and bounce angles, which affect how the club interacts with the turf. Common types include traditional blade wedges for skilled players and cavity-back wedges for those seeking forgiveness on mis-hits.

Avoid common mistakes like choosing a wedge solely based on looks or purchasing one that doesn’t suit your swing style.

**forged irons.** When shopping for forged irons, it's essential to understand their benefits and specifications.
