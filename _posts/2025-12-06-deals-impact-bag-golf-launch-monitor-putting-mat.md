A gap wedge fills the distance gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, making it ideal for approach shots, delicate chips, and fuller swing scenarios. Look for specifications like the club’s loft, bounce angle, and length, as these affect how the club interacts with the turf and how it performs on various lies.

Look for specifications such as loft, bounce, and grind that suit your playing style and course conditions. Common types include a standard loft wedge (50-52 degrees) for approach shots and a lob wedge (58-60 degrees) for flops and delicate chips. 

Avoid common mistakes like choosing a wedge with an inappropriate bounce for your swing type or neglecting to consider how the finish may affect maintenance and durability over time.
