Today’s shortlist is built for speed: a bit of context first, then focused filters to scan prices and specs quickly. Today’s quick cuts:

### Drivers by Budget

**Drivers by Budget.** A fast way to compare current options and pricing:

**high MOI driver.** Scan size/fit details and return policy before checkout. Use this search to jump straight into relevant options and filter by price, reviews and shipping.

_What to compare:_
- Price vs review count
- Sizing/fit & returns
- Fast shipping if timing matters

**draw bias driver.** Use this search to jump straight into relevant options and filter by price, reviews and shipping. Sort by rating with a minimum review count to avoid paid noise. Scan size/fit details and return policy before checkout.

_What to compare:_

**driver under $500.** Expect better ball-speed retention on mishits and refined acoustics. Swing-weight and shaft profile vary by vendor—check the spec sheet.

_What to compare:_
- Stock shaft profile fit
- Spin window vs launch (mid/low spin if you launch high)
- Sound/feel preference (confidence matters)
