### FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between a gap wedge and players distance irons?**

A gap wedge is typically designed for short approach shots, filling the distance gap between pitching wedges and sand wedges, often featuring higher loft for better control around the greens. Players distance irons, on the other hand, are engineered to offer a balance of distance and playability, incorporating features that enhance forgiveness while still appealing to skilled players.

**Q: How do forged irons compare to hollow body irons?**

Forged irons are crafted from a single piece of metal, providing a soft feel and superior feedback, making them popular among better players. Hollow body irons, however, feature a hollow construction which helps to increase forgiveness and launch, making them suitable for golfers looking for distance and accuracy without sacrificing playability.

**Q: What are the benefits of using alignment sticks during practice?**

Alignment sticks are versatile training aids that help golfers improve their alignment, posture, and swing path. They can be used on the driving range or during practice sessions to ensure proper setup and to develop consistent swing mechanics, ultimately leading to improved accuracy and performance on the course.
