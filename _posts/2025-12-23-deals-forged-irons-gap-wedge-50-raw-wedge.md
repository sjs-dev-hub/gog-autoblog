Look for specifications such as the material used, typically carbon steel, which enhances playability. Avoid common mistakes like choosing weight and loft without considering your swing mechanics. 

Consider options like blade-style forged irons for a traditional look and compact feel or cavity-back forged irons for added forgiveness and playability.

When selecting a gap wedge, consider factors such as loft, bounce, and shaft material. A gap wedge typically features a loft of 50 degrees, making it ideal for approach shots from 100 to 120 yards. 

Common mistakes include choosing a wedge that does not complement your existing set or failing to consider how the wedge's bounce affects turf interaction. Look for options like a standard gap wedge for versatile play or a high-lofted gap wedge for more precise shots around the green.

Look for specifications like loft, bounce, and grind, as these will influence how the club interacts with the turf. Common types include a traditional pitching wedge for general approach shots and a lob wedge for high, soft landings.
