### Irons & Wedges

**hollow body irons.** Hollow body irons are designed to enhance distance and forgiveness, making them a great option for golfers seeking to improve their game. These clubs typically feature a lightweight, hollow construction that allows for a larger sweet spot and better energy transfer on impact. When shopping for hollow body irons, consider factors like loft options, shaft flex, and overall feel. Look for models with a low center of gravity for higher launch angles and easy playability. Brands like Callaway, TaylorMade, and Ping offer popular options. Test various models to find the right balance between distance and accuracy that suits your swing style.

**players distance irons.** When shopping for players distance irons, prioritize a balance of distance, forgiveness, and control. Look for clubs with a thinner face design and a lower center of gravity to enhance ball speed while maintaining accuracy. Check for features like hollow body construction or perimeter weighting, which can improve forgiveness on off-center hits. Consider the shaft material and flex to match your swing speed for optimal performance. Brands like TaylorMade, Callaway, and Ping offer popular options in this category. Always test clubs in-store or through demo days to find the best feel and performance for your game.

**raw wedge.** When shopping for a raw wedge, look for key features that enhance performance around the greens. Raw wedges, typically made from soft carbon steel, provide excellent spin and feel. Focus on the loft options – 52°, 56°, and 60° are popular choices for versatile short game play. Check for grind options that suit your swing type and turf conditions. Pay attention to the groove design; sharper, deeper grooves increase spin on shorter shots. Brands like Titleist, Cleveland, and Callaway offer reputable models. Finally, consider customizations like shaft length and grip size to ensure the best fit for your game.

**gap wedge 50.** A gap wedge (50°) is essential for filling the distance gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, typically covering distances from 80 to 100 yards. When buying a gap wedge, consider the bounce angle, which affects how the club interacts with the turf; a higher bounce is better for softer conditions, while lower bounce works well on firmer ground. Look for a wedge that matches your existing set in terms of brand and feel for consistency. Pay attention to the shaft material—steel for control or graphite for lighter weight. Brands like Titleist, Callaway, and Cleveland offer solid options, so check for sales or bundled deals to maximize savings.

### Training & Tech

**swing analyzer.** When shopping for a swing analyzer, look for key features like real-time feedback, data accuracy, and compatibility with your smartphone or tablet. Devices that offer metrics such as swing speed, angle, and tempo can help you refine your technique. Consider portability—some analyzers attach to clubs, while others are standalone units. Battery life and durability are also important for on-course use. Popular options include the Arccos Caddie and the Blast Motion Golf Sensor, which provide comprehensive insights. Always check for user reviews to ensure the product meets your specific needs. Aim for a balance between functionality and ease of use within your budget.

**impact bag.** When shopping for an impact bag, prioritize durability and design. Look for a heavy-duty construction that withstands repeated use, as well as a bag that maintains its shape to simulate proper ball impact. Consider options with adjustable weights to tailor resistance for your training needs. A good impact bag should have a textured surface for better grip and stability. Check for portability features, like handles or straps, if you plan to use it at different locations. Brands like SKLZ and Callaway offer reliable options, often at competitive prices. Always read reviews to ensure quality and effectiveness before purchasing.

Choose a model with alignment lines to help improve your stroke and aim. Opt for a mirror with a non-slip backing to keep it stable during practice. Size matters; a larger mirror provides a wider view to analyze your stance and posture. Additionally, consider a model that includes guides for ball placement and eye alignment. Prices range from $20 to $100, so set a budget based on frequency of use and your commitment to improving your putting game.
