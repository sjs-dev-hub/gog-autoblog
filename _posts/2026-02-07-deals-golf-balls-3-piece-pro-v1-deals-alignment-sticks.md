### Buyer Tips

- Check launch angle, spin, and shaft fit
- Compare forgiveness vs. workability
- Read recent reviews, not old models

#### Drivers by Budget

**high MOI driver.** When shopping for a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver, consider how it can enhance your game by providing greater stability and forgiveness on off-center strikes. A higher MOI helps maintain ball speed and reduces twisting during impact, resulting in straighter drives. Focus on specifications such as the weight distribution, shaft flexibility, and clubhead size, as these factors greatly influence performance.

Common mistakes include overlooking the importance of a proper fit for your swing style and failing to test different models for feel and handling. Look for driver types like oversized heads or adjustable weights, which can help optimize your performance.

###

_What to compare:_
- **Clubhead Size**: A larger clubhead typically offers a higher MOI.
- **Weight Distribution**: Check for designs that enhance stability and forgiveness.
- **Shaft Options**: Consider flexibility and length to match your swing dynamics.

**driver under $500.** Shopping for a driver under $500 can be a rewarding experience, offering high-quality options without breaking the bank. When selecting a driver, consider features such as loft angle, shaft flexibility, and overall weight, as these specifications can significantly affect your swing and distance.
