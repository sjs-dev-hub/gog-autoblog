#### Irons & Wedges

**raw wedge** — When shopping for a raw wedge, it's essential to consider its unique benefits and specifications to enhance your short game. A raw wedge, often featuring a non-plated finish, provides increased spin and better control due to enhanced surface texture. Look for options with various lofts and bounce angles to match your playing style and course conditions. Common types include a lob wedge for high shots around the green and a sand wedge designed for bunker play.

To avoid common mistakes, be mindful of the grip size and shaft flex that suit your swing.

**gap wedge 50** — When shopping for a 50-degree gap wedge, consider its role in your short game, bridging the distance between your pitching wedge and sand wedge. This club is ideal for approach shots and delicate chips, allowing for better control over trajectory and spin. Look for a wedge with a comfortable grip and a shaft length that suits your height and swing style. 

Common mistakes include selecting a wedge without understanding loft differences or neglecting the bounce, which affects how the club interacts with the ground.

Look for balls designed with specific winter characteristics, such as softer covers for better grip in colder temperatures and a lower compression rating to maintain distance even in chilly conditions. 

Common mistakes include choosing balls designed for warmer weather, which may not perform optimally in the cold. It's also crucial to consider ball construction; a two-piece ball often provides durability, while a multi-layer ball can enhance spin control.
