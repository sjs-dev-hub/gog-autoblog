Avoid common mistakes, such as prioritizing aesthetics over functionality or failing to test the driver for feel and comfort.

Generic example product types include a standard 460cc driver, known for its forgiveness, or a lightweight carbon-fiber model, favored for increased swing speed.

Common mistakes include choosing the wrong shaft flex or length, which can impact swing dynamics. 

Examples of forged iron options include muscle-back irons, designed for precision, and cavity-back irons, which offer more forgiveness for mid to low handicappers.
