Look for features like a compact head profile for precision and a softer, more responsive material that enhances control. Avoid common mistakes such as selecting irons that are too advanced for your current skills or overlooking the importance of proper shaft flex, which can impact your swing. 

Examples of forged irons include muscle-back and cavity-back designs, each catering to different preferences and performance needs.

Common mistakes include focusing solely on distance and ignoring feel or forgiveness.

For example, consider a hollow-bodied iron or a forged cavity back, both of which can deliver excellent performance for mid-handicap to advanced players.

Raw wedges, often uncoated, provide better spin and feel due to their softer metal construction, allowing for more control around the greens. Look for specifications such as loft, bounce, and grind, as these will affect your play style and course conditions. Common mistakes include choosing a wedge solely based on aesthetics or not matching it to your swing characteristics. 

Examples of product types to consider are a raw pitching wedge designed for precision on approach shots and a raw lob wedge optimized for high, soft landings.

A 50-degree gap wedge fills the distance between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, typically covering 100-120 yards for most golfers. Look for a wedge with a comfortable grip and suitable weight to enhance your short game performance. 

Common mistakes include choosing a wedge with too much bounce for firm turf or opting for an overly heavy shaft that can hinder control. Examples of gap wedges include those with a classic blade design or cavity back options, both offering unique benefits in terms of feel and forgiveness.
