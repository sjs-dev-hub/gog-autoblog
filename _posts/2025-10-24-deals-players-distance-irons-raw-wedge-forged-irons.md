### FAQ

**Q: What’s the difference between players distance irons and forged irons?**

Players distance irons are designed to offer a combination of distance and forgiveness, often featuring a larger clubface and a more forgiving construction. Forged irons, on the other hand, are crafted from a solid piece of metal for enhanced feel and control, appealing to more skilled players who prioritize precision over distance.

**Q: How does a raw wedge differ from a gap wedge?**

A raw wedge has a non-plated finish that enhances spin and is preferred for its feel around the greens, while a gap wedge, typically with a loft between pitching and sand wedges, is designed to fill the distance gap and provide versatility for various shots around the green.

**Q: What benefits do winter golf balls provide compared to standard golf balls?**

Winter golf balls, often available in bright colors like yellow for better visibility in snowy conditions, are designed to maintain performance in colder temperatures. They may feature a softer core for enhanced feel and better performance on shorter shots, while still providing distance on full swings.
