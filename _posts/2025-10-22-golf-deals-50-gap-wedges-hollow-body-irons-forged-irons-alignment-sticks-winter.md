Today’s shortlist is built for speed: a bit of context first, then focused filters to scan prices and specs quickly. Today’s quick cuts:

### Irons & Wedges

**Irons & Wedges.** Use these filters when you want clarity, not clutter:

**gap wedge 50.** A 50° wedge bridges modern PW-to-SW gaps for tighter yardages. Keep shaft and swing-weight consistent with your irons. Bounce and sole grind should match your turf and delivery.

_What to compare:_
- Shaft match to irons
- Bounce/grind for turf/sand
- Groove sharpness & durability

**hollow body irons.** Scan size/fit details and return policy before checkout. Use this search to jump straight into relevant options and filter by price, reviews and shipping. Sort by rating with a minimum review count to avoid paid noise.

_What to compare:_
- Fast shipping if timing matters
- Model year / tech carryover
- Sizing/fit & returns

**forged irons.** Forged heads emphasize feedback and flight control. Finish durability varies—raw, chrome and PVD wear differently.

_What to compare:_
- Finish durability
- Swing-weight consistency
- Blade length & sole geometry
- Bounce/grind through set

### Balls & Accessories

**Balls & Accessories.** Clean jumping-off points with minimal noise:

**alignment sticks.** Gate drills sharpen start line and face control. High-contrast colors stay visible in rough or low light.

_What to compare:_

- End caps for safety
- Stiffness & length
