#### Irons & Wedges

**hollow body irons.** When shopping for hollow body irons, it's essential to understand their unique benefits and specifications. These clubs offer a blend of distance and forgiveness, designed to enhance performance for golfers of various skill levels. The hollow construction allows for a lower center of gravity, promoting higher launch angles and improved accuracy. Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or not considering the club's weight and feel, which can impact your swing.

Consider options such as a 4-iron hollow body design for added distance or a 7-iron model for versatile performance.

Key specifications to examine include the club’s weight, shaft flex, and loft angle, as these will influence your swing dynamics. A common mistake is choosing irons based solely on aesthetics rather than how they match your skill level and swing style.

Common mistakes include ignoring the bounce angle, which affects how the club interacts with the turf, or not trying out different shaft flex options, which can impact your swing dynamics. Look for options like cast or forged gap wedges, each offering unique feel and performance characteristics.
