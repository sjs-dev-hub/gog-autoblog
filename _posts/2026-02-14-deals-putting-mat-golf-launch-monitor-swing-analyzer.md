Look for specifications such as a moderate offset, which helps with forgiveness, and a robust clubhead design that promotes stability at impact. Common mistakes include overlooking the importance of shaft material and flex, which can significantly affect performance. 

Examples of product types include hollow-body irons, which provide a larger sweet spot for enhanced distance, and forged irons, which offer a softer feel and better feedback on shots.

**

_What to compare:_
- **
- **Loft and lie angles**: Ensure they suit your playing style and swing characteristics.

**hollow body irons.** When shopping for hollow body irons, it's essential to consider the benefits, specifications, and common mistakes. These clubs typically feature a hollow construction, enhancing forgiveness and increasing distance by redistributing weight for a larger sweet spot. Look for features such as a lower center of gravity for improved launch angle and more consistent ball flight.

Common mistakes include overlooking shaft flex and length, which can significantly affect performance. Additionally, be wary of choosing a design that doesn’t suit your typical swing speed or style. 

For concrete examples, consider looking into models with a shorter blade length for enhanced control or those with a thicker face for added distance.

Forged irons are crafted from a single piece of metal, offering better feel and control over your shots.

A common mistake is choosing a set purely based on aesthetics rather than how they fit your game. 

Examples of forged iron types include muscle-back models for advanced players seeking precision and cavity-back designs that offer a balance of forgiveness and playability for mid-handicappers.
