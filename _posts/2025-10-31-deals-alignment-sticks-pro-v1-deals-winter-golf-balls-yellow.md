#### Irons & Wedges

**forged irons.** When shopping for forged irons, it's essential to consider how they can enhance your game. Known for their superior feel and control, forged irons offer a softer clubface that allows for better feedback on impact. Look for specifications such as the club's loft, lie angle, and shaft material to ensure a tailored fit. A common mistake is prioritizing aesthetics over performance; focus on how the club performs for your swing style. 

Examples of forged irons include cavity-back models, which provide forgiveness, and muscle-back options, designed for skilled players seeking precision.
