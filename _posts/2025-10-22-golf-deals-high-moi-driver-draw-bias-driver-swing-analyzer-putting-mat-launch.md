Practical picks only—each section outlines the decision points so you know what matters before you click. Here’s what we’re tracking right now:

### Drivers by Budget

**Drivers by Budget.** Use these filters when you want clarity, not clutter:

**driver under $500.** When selecting a driver under $500, prioritize finding the right fit for your swing characteristics rather than just the latest models. Consider factors such as loft, shaft flexibility, and grip size, as these elements significantly impact performance. Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or brand reputation instead of how the driver feels during your swing. Always test the club before purchasing, if possible, and think about your skill level and playing style to ensure the driver complements your game. Investing time in these considerations can lead to a more satisfying and effective choice.

_What to compare:_
- Check shaft length for comfort and control
- Assess loft to match your swing speed
- Experiment with different shaft flexibilities
- Evaluate grip size for optimal comfort
- Test the driver for feel and performance

**high MOI driver.** When selecting a high MOI driver, focus on how it fits your swing style and physical attributes. A driver with a high Moment of Inertia (MOI) is designed for greater stability and forgiveness on off-center hits, which helps improve consistency. Ensure the shaft length and flex suit your swing speed and mechanics to maximize performance. Be cautious of overly heavy heads that can hinder your swing speed. Finally, consider the adjustability features to fine-tune loft and lie angles for optimal launch conditions.

_What to compare:_
- Assess your swing speed for appropriate shaft flex
- Ensure driver head weight supports your swing style
- Check for adjustability in loft and lie settings
- Test different lengths to find what feels comfortable
- Evaluate grip size for better control during swings

**draw bias driver.** When selecting a draw bias driver, it's essential to focus on specifications that cater to your swing style. Look for a driver with an adjustable weight system, allowing you to fine-tune the center of gravity to promote a draw. Pay attention to the loft, as a higher loft can help reduce side spin and improve accuracy. Additionally, consider the shaft flex; a shaft that matches your swing speed can maximize distance and control. Lastly, evaluate the cover material for durability and feel, ensuring a balance between performance and longevity.
