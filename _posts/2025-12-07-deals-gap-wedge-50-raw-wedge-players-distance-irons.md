### Gear Insights

#### Irons & Wedges

**gap wedge 50** — When shopping for a 50-degree gap wedge, consider your playing style and the gaps in your set of clubs. Gap wedges are designed to bridge the distance between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, offering versatility for approach shots and delicate chips. Look for specifications such as loft, bounce, and shaft length, as these can significantly impact your performance.

Common mistakes include overlooking the material of the clubhead and grip, which can affect feel and control. For instance, a forged model may offer better feedback for skilled players, while a cast model might provide more durability for beginners.

**raw wedge** — When shopping for a raw wedge, consider its unique benefits, including enhanced spin and control due to its uncoated finish. Raw wedges develop a patina over time, which can improve grip on the ball and enhance performance in various conditions. Key specifications to look for include loft options typically ranging from 50 to 64 degrees, bounce angles suited to your playing style, and grind types that suit your turf preferences.

**players distance irons** — When shopping for players distance irons, it’s essential to focus on the right blend of distance, control, and forgiveness. These irons typically feature a thin face design, promoting higher ball speeds while maintaining accuracy. Look for specifications such as loft angles, shaft options, and overall club weight to find a set that complements your swing style. Common mistakes include overlooking the importance of proper fitting or selecting irons solely based on aesthetics.
