### Gear Insights

#### Drivers by Budget

**driver under $500** — When shopping for a driver under $500, focus on finding the right balance between performance and comfort. Look for features like adjustable loft and lie angles, which can enhance your ball flight and overall control. Pay attention to the clubhead size and weight, as these affect forgiveness and swing speed.

**high MOI driver** — When shopping for a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver, it's essential to understand its benefits and specifications. High MOI drivers are designed to reduce twisting upon impact, providing enhanced stability and forgiveness on off-center hits. Look for features such as a larger clubhead, adjustable weight distribution, and a low center of gravity, which can further improve your performance.

Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or ignoring shaft flexibility, both of which can affect your swing. Consider trying different head shapes like a traditional pear or a more oversized design, both of which can offer varied performance benefits.
