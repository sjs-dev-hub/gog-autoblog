#### Training & Tech

**putting mirror** — When shopping for a putting mirror, prioritize features that enhance your training experience. A putting mirror helps golfers improve alignment and stroke consistency by providing immediate visual feedback. Look for mirrors that are large enough to see your reflection without straining and that come with alignment lines to guide your setup.

Common mistakes include choosing a mirror that’s too small to provide a comprehensive view or one without durable construction, which can impact its longevity. Some mirrors also offer adjustable angles for personalized adjustments, which can be beneficial.

**gap wedge 50** — When shopping for a 50-degree gap wedge, it's essential to understand its role in your short game. This club fills the distance gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, providing precision for approach shots and chip shots around the green. Look for specifications like club length, weight, and loft to ensure a comfortable fit for your swing style.
