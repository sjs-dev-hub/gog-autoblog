Adjustable loft and lie settings can also contribute to improved performance for varying swing styles. Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics rather than functionality, or neglecting to test the weight and grip size for comfort.

Consider options like a high-MOI driver or a lightweight composite driver to maximize your game improvement journey.
