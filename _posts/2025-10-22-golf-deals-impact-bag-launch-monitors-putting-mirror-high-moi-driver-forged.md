Practical picks only—each section outlines the decision points so you know what matters before you click. Here’s what we’re tracking right now:

### Training & Tech

**Training & Tech.** Clean jumping-off points with minimal noise:

**impact bag.** Scan size/fit details and return policy before checkout. Sort by rating with a minimum review count to avoid paid noise. Use this search to jump straight into relevant options and filter by price, reviews and shipping.

_What to compare:_
- Fast shipping if timing matters
- Model year / tech carryover
- Sizing/fit & returns
- Price vs review count

**golf launch monitor.** Exportable shot libraries make progress trackable. Personal launch monitors are accurate enough outdoors for gapping. Indoors, prioritize units that measure spin and club data.

_What to compare:_
- Measured vs modeled data
- App export & session history
- Outdoor flight capture quality
- Battery life & mounting ease
