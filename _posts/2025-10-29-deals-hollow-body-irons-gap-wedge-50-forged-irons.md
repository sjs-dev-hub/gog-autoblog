#### Irons & Wedges

These irons are designed with a hollow construction that maximizes performance, making them ideal for players seeking a blend of speed and precision. When selecting hollow body irons, consider specifications such as face material, weight distribution, and loft options.

**gap wedge 50** — When shopping for a gap wedge, typically around 50 degrees of loft, it's essential to consider several factors to enhance your short game. A gap wedge bridges the distance between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, making it invaluable for approach shots from 100 to 120 yards. Look for specifications such as shaft material, length, and grip size that suit your swing style. Avoid common mistakes like opting for a wedge that’s too heavy or inflexible, as these can hinder accuracy.

Example product types include a classic cavity-back gap wedge for better forgiveness or a blade-style wedge for enhanced control.

Look for specifications such as club head material, loft, and shaft flexibility, as these can significantly impact performance. Common types include muscle-back irons, which provide a compact profile for shot-shaping, and cavity-back irons, offering a larger sweet spot for forgiveness. 

Avoid common mistakes like choosing irons solely based on aesthetics or relying too heavily on recommendations without considering your unique playing style.
