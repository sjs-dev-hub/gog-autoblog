1. **Weight Distribution**: Look for models that optimize weight for better launch and control.
2. **Face Technology**: Check for features like variable face thickness for improved ball speed.
3. **Shaft Options**: Ensure the irons come with suitable shaft flex for your swing speed.
4. **Set Composition**: Consider if you need a full set or just a few key clubs. 

Test different brands to find the best feel and performance for your game.

**raw wedge.** When looking to buy a raw wedge, consider the following key factors: 

1. **Loft and Bounce**: Choose a loft that complements your existing clubs, typically between 50° and 64°. Bounce should match your playing conditions; higher bounce for soft turf and lower for firm surfaces.

2. **Grind Options**: Different grinds (standard, low, high) affect how the club interacts with the ground. Pick one that suits your swing style and typical lies.

3. **Material**: Raw wedges can rust, enhancing spin. Ensure you’re comfortable with the aesthetic change and consider maintenance.

4. **Feel**: Test for comfort and feedback; a good wedge should feel responsive.

Always try before you buy if possible to ensure the right fit for your game.
