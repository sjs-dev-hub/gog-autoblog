Practical picks only—each section explains the decision points, then links you straight to high-intent results. Highlights for your next range session or checkout:

### Irons & Wedges

**players distance irons.** Hollow-body or thin-face designs give speed with a compact look. Great for mid-caps chasing ball speed without a shovelly profile.

_What to compare:_
- Loft jacking (watch gapping at the bottom)
- Forgiveness vs topline preference
- Shaft weight/profile match
- Set blending with GI long irons

**forged irons.** Forged heads emphasize feel and workability. They’re less forgiving but reward center strikes with precise flight windows.

_What to compare:_
- Blade length & sole width (turf interaction)
- Bounce & grind through the set
- Swing-weight consistency
- Chroming/durability of finish

**gap wedge 50.** A 50° gap wedge bridges modern iron lofts and your 56/60. It tightens yardage gaps and adds a versatile flight around the green.

_What to compare:_
- Loft/lie fit relative to PW & SW
- Bounce/grind for your turf/sand
- Groove sharpness & spin durability
- Shaft match to your irons

### Training & Tech

**putting mat.** Roll quality matters more than gimmicks. A 9–11 stimp is realistic for home use and helps distance control drills stick.

_What to compare:_
- Mat speed & trueness
- Return track or drop-cup
- Alignment guides for start line
- Storage (roll-up without creases)

**golf launch monitor.** Personal launch monitors are now accurate enough outdoors to guide gapping and equipment choices. Indoors, look for better spin/club tracking.

_What to compare:_
- Measured vs modeled spin/club data
- Outdoor ball-flight capture quality
- Software/app export (CSV/shot library)
- Battery life and tripod/leveling ease

**swing analyzer.** Wearable sensors reveal face/path tendencies and tempo ratios. They’re best for practice sessions—not tournament rounds.

_What to compare:_
- Club or glove mount options
- Face/path/tempo metrics reported
- Video sync for feedback
- Subscription cost vs features

### Balls & Accessories

**swing tempo trainer.** Tempo trainers smooth sequencing and help create repeatable rhythm—particularly helpful for players who rush from the top.

_What to compare:_
- Weight placement (heavy head promotes shallowing)
- Length (longer = more tempo feedback)
- Flex profile (more whip = better timing cues)
- Indoor-safe grip/cover

**Pro V1 deals.** This is a high-intent search—use it to jump straight to relevant options and filter by price, reviews, and shipping.

_What to compare:_
- Price vs review count (value > hype)
- Recent model year or tech carryover
- Size/fit options and returns
- Prime/fast shipping when timing matters

**golf balls 3 piece.** Three-piece designs balance price with performance: typically ionomer covers with lively cores for speed and decent flight control.

_What to compare:_
- Cover (urethane = more spin; ionomer = value/durability)
- Dimple pattern (wind stability)
- Compression (softer feel for slower speeds)
- Color/visibility on overcast days

**alignment sticks.** Cheap, high-leverage training aid. Use two on the ground for stance and target line; mix in gate drills for start-line control.

_What to compare:_
- Length & stiffness (don’t bend too easily)
- High-contrast color (visibility on grass)
- Caps for safety (no sharp ends)
- Bundle with clips for plane/putting gates
