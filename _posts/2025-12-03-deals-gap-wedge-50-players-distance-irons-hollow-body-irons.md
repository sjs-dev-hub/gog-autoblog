Common mistakes include choosing the wrong loft based on your typical distances or neglecting to consider how it fits in with your existing set. 

Popular types to consider include a classic cavity-back design for versatility or a more specialized model with an enhanced sole for improved turf interaction.

These clubs typically feature a compact design, providing a traditional look while incorporating advanced technology for enhanced performance. Look for specifications like the club's loft, shaft material, and grip size, as these can significantly affect your game. A common mistake is to prioritize distance over feel; ensure the clubs are comfortable to swing and offer adequate feedback on impact.
