#### Drivers by Budget

**high MOI driver.** When shopping for a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver, it's essential to understand how these clubs enhance stability and forgiveness, particularly on off-center hits. A higher MOI helps maintain clubhead speed and direction, leading to longer, straighter drives. Look for specifications such as weight distribution, clubhead design, and shaft flexibility, which all play a crucial role in performance. 

Common types of high MOI drivers include those with a larger, more forgiving clubhead shape or those featuring adjustable weight technology for personalized customization.
