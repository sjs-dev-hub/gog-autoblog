Look for specifications such as loft angle, adjustable weighting, and face angle, as these can significantly affect performance. Common mistakes include not considering swing speed and failing to test different models to find the best fit. 

Examples of draw bias drivers include adjustable models that allow customization of weights and fixed-face options designed specifically for players struggling with a slice.

**high MOI driver.** When shopping for a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver, prioritize stability and forgiveness on off-center hits. A high MOI design typically results in a larger clubhead that redistributes weight to the perimeter, minimizing twisting during impact for more consistent drives. Look for features like adjustable weights or an oversized face, which can enhance playability. 

Common types of high MOI drivers include those with a larger clubhead volume or models designed with a low center of gravity, both of which can be beneficial for beginners to intermediates.

Common mistakes include overlooking the importance of grip size and weight, which can impact comfort and performance. Look for drivers designed with forgiving face technology, such as those with a larger sweet spot, or adjustable hosels that allow for customization of loft and lie angles.

Avoid common mistakes like focusing solely on aesthetics; instead, prioritize how the driver feels during your swing.
