Common types of high MOI drivers include oversized models and those with adjustable weights, both designed to enhance performance for a variety of swing styles.

Look for a driver with adjustable loft and face angles, which can help customize your swing and improve distance. Consider the shaft material—graphite options tend to be lighter, offering increased swing speed.

Look for features like adjustable weights and face angles, which can influence shot shape and trajectory. Consider the loft of the driver, as a higher loft can help launch the ball more effectively. Avoid common mistakes such as selecting a driver solely based on aesthetics or price without considering your unique swing characteristics.

Common mistakes include selecting trainers that are too rigid or not allowing for natural swing variations.

Typically, these balls feature a solid core, a rubber layer, and a durable outer cover, which work together to deliver optimal performance. Common mistakes include choosing a ball solely based on feel without considering swing speed or playing style. For example, a three-piece ball designed for low compression might suit slower swing speeds, while a firmer model can benefit faster swingers.

_What to compare:_
- Core construction: Look for variations in the materials used for maximum energy transfer.
- Cover material: Examine options like urethane or ionomer for durability and spin characteristics.

Look for specifications such as the loft angle, shaft material, and weight distribution, as these factors impact performance. Common mistakes include choosing irons solely based on looks or feel without considering how they complement your swing style.

Forged irons are crafted from a solid piece of metal, resulting in a softer feel and enhanced feedback on impact. This can be particularly advantageous for players seeking precision and control in their shots. However, common mistakes include prioritizing aesthetics over functionality or opting for the wrong shaft flex, which can negatively impact performance.

Consider types such as cavity-back forged irons, which offer forgiveness while maintaining feel, or blade forged irons, preferred by advanced players for their shot-shaping capabilities.

Look for specifications such as the loft angle, shaft material, and overall weight to ensure the clubs match your swing style. Common types of hollow body irons include game improvement models, which focus on forgiveness, and players' models that offer more control for advanced players.

Raw wedges, often crafted from softer metals, provide increased spin and enhance feel around the greens. Look for features like loft, bounce, and grind options to tailor your wedge to various turf conditions and shot types. A common mistake is choosing a wedge solely based on aesthetics rather than performance factors. 

Generic examples include a 56-degree raw sand wedge for bunker play and a 60-degree lob wedge for delicate chips and flop shots.
