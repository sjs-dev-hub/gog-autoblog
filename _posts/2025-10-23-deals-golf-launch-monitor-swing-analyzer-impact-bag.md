#### Drivers by Budget

**high MOI driver.** When shopping for a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver, consider the benefits it offers, such as increased forgiveness on off-center hits and improved stability during your swing. Look for specifications that highlight a larger clubhead, typically above 460cc, and a design that promotes weight distribution towards the perimeter of the clubhead. Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics rather than performance metrics. For a well-rounded option, consider drivers that feature adjustable weighting systems or those with an aerodynamic shape to enhance swing speed.

Look for specifications such as adjustable weights, loft options, and clubhead design, as these features significantly impact performance. A common mistake is neglecting to test different shaft flexes, which can affect your swing dynamics and accuracy.

For concrete examples, consider a draw bias driver with adjustable weights for customization or one with a larger clubhead for increased forgiveness on off-center hits.

**driver under $500.** When shopping for a driver under $500, it’s essential to focus on features that enhance your performance. Look for adjustable loft and lie settings, which allow you to customize the club to your swing style. Pay attention to the clubhead size; larger heads typically offer a larger sweet spot, making it easier to hit straighter shots. However, avoid common pitfalls such as prioritizing aesthetics over performance or neglecting to test the feel of the club. 

Consider trying out different shaft options, such as a stiff flex for faster swing speeds or a regular flex for more control. Popular types to consider include a titanium driver for lightweight performance or a composite driver for enhanced forgiveness.

Raw wedges, often made from soft carbon steel, provide better feel and control, allowing for precision shots around the greens. Look for specifications like loft, bounce, and grind, as these factors significantly impact performance based on your swing style and course conditions. Common mistakes include choosing a wedge solely based on aesthetics or selecting one with inappropriate bounce for their typical playing surface.
