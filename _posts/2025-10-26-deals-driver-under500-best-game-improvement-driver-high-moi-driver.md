Look for bags made from durable materials that can withstand repeated strikes, and ensure it has the appropriate weight to simulate real impact without being overly heavy.

Common mistakes include choosing an overly small bag, which may not provide adequate feedback, or one that is too lightweight, failing to mimic the resistance experienced during a real swing.
