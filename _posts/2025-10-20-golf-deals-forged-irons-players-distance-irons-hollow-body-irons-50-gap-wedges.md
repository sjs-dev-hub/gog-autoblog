If you want value without doom-scrolling, start here. We explain what to compare, then link straight into high-intent searches. Start with these categories:

### Irons & Wedges

**Irons & Wedges.** Clean jumping-off points with minimal noise:

**forged irons.** Finish durability varies—raw, chrome and PVD wear differently. Sole width and bounce must match your turf. Forged heads emphasize feedback and flight control.

_What to compare:_
- Blade length & sole geometry
- Finish durability
- Bounce/grind through set
- Swing-weight consistency

**players distance irons.** Loft jacking is common—check gapping at the bottom. Blend sets if you want GI long irons with sleeker scoring clubs. Hollow or thin-face designs give ball speed in compact shapes.

_What to compare:_
- Shaft weight/profile
- Forgiveness vs topline look
- Loft & gapping
- Blend options across set

_What to compare:_
- Price vs review count
- Model year / tech carryover
- Fast shipping if timing matters
- Sizing/fit & returns

_What to compare:_
- Loft/lie relative to PW & SW
- Shaft match to irons
- Groove sharpness & durability
- Bounce/grind for turf/sand

- App export & session history
