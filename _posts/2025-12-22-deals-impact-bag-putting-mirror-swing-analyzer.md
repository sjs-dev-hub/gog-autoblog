#### Irons & Wedges

**gap wedge 50.** When shopping for a 50-degree gap wedge, it's important to consider its role in your short game. This club helps bridge the distance gap between your pitching wedge and sand wedge, allowing for more precise approach shots and better control around the greens. Look for features like the club’s loft, bounce angle, and sole design, as these can greatly influence playability and performance. Avoid common mistakes such as not trying the club before purchasing or selecting a model that doesn't fit your swing style. 

Consider exploring options like a cavity-back design for forgiveness, or a blade-style for enhanced feel and control.

**

_What to compare:_
- **
- Loft and bounce angle for optimal versatility.

**hollow body irons.** When shopping for hollow body irons, it's essential to understand their unique benefits, which include improved distance, increased forgiveness, and a higher launch angle. These clubs typically feature a hollow construction that enhances weight distribution, allowing for better ball speed and control. Look for specifications such as the loft angle, shaft material, and swing weight, which can greatly affect performance.

Common mistakes include focusing solely on aesthetics or price rather than performance features. Additionally, neglecting to test the clubs before purchasing can lead to a mismatch in feel and playability.

**forged irons.** When shopping for forged irons, it's essential to understand their benefits, specifications, and potential pitfalls. Forged irons are renowned for their superior feel and control, making them a popular choice among skilled players who prioritize precision. Consider factors such as the club's loft, lie angle, and shaft flex, as these will significantly impact your performance. 

Common mistakes include choosing a set that doesn't match your skill level or playing style. For example, a player may opt for a muscle-back iron, which offers enhanced feedback, but may not provide the forgiveness needed for those still honing their skills. Alternatively, cavity-back irons offer more forgiveness with a larger sweet spot.
