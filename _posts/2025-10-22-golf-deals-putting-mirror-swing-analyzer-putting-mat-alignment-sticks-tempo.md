### Balls & Accessories

**Balls & Accessories.** A fast way to compare current options and pricing:

**Pro V1 deals.** Bulk pricing swings during season changes and holidays. Compression and feel affect distance control more than raw speed. Urethane covers provide greenside spin and wind control.

- Clips for plane/putting drills
- Color visibility

➡️  [See alignment sticks on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=alignment%20sticks&tag=guildofgolfde-20)

**swing tempo trainer.** Heavier heads promote rhythm over hit impulse. Weighted or whippy trainers smooth sequencing from the top. Longer versions exaggerate timing cues for feel learners.

_What to compare:_
- Head weight placement
- Flex/whip profile
- Overall length
- Indoor-safe grip/cover
