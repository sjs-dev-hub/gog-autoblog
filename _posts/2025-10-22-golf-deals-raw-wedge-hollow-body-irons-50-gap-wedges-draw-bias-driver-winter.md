**gap wedge 50.** Keep shaft and swing-weight consistent with your irons. A 50° wedge bridges modern PW-to-SW gaps for tighter yardages. Bounce and sole grind should match your turf and delivery.

_What to compare:_
- Groove sharpness & durability

**driver under $500.** Current-gen drivers bring tighter tolerances and more adjustable weighting. Expect better ball-speed retention on mishits and refined acoustics. Swing-weight and shaft profile vary by vendor—check the spec sheet.

_What to compare:_
- Spin window vs launch (mid/low spin if you launch high)
- Stock shaft profile fit
- Sound/feel preference (confidence matters)
