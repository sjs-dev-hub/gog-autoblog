#### Balls & Accessories

**winter golf balls yellow.** When shopping for yellow winter golf balls, consider their visibility against the stark winter landscape, which enhances tracking your shots. Look for balls specifically designed for cold weather, as they often feature softer cores to maintain their performance in lower temperatures. Focus on dimple patterns that provide good lift and stability in windy conditions. A common misconception is choosing balls based solely on color; however, the construction and material are equally important. 

Examples of types to consider include two-piece construction balls for durability and distance, or multi-layer balls for better control and feel around the greens.

**

_What to compare:_
- **
- Compression ratings for cold weather performance
- Dimple design for aerodynamic stability
- Ball construction type (two-piece vs. multi-layer)

**alignment sticks.** When shopping for alignment sticks, consider their role in enhancing your golf practice by improving your setup and swing path. Look for lightweight options, often made from durable materials like fiberglass or aluminum, which make them easy to carry and set up on the driving range. Avoid common mistakes such as choosing sticks that are too short or inflexible, as this can hinder your training. Examples of alignment sticks include classic straight sticks and flexible training rods that curve to create different target lines.

**

These balls typically feature a soft outer layer for feel, a responsive core for energy transfer, and a durable middle layer to balance performance. Look for specifications like compression rating, which affects how the ball reacts to your swing speed, and the cover material, which influences durability and spin.

Common types of three-piece golf balls include those designed for performance and those aimed at achieving maximum distance.
