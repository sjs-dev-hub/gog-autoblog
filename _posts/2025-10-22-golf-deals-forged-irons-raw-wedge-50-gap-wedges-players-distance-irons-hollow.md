Practical picks only—each section outlines the decision points so you know what matters before you click. Here’s what we’re tracking right now:

### Irons & Wedges

**Irons & Wedges.** A fast way to compare current options and pricing:

**forged irons.** When considering forged irons, focus on the feel and performance that suits your swing style. Forged irons are known for their better feedback on contact and enhanced control, making them ideal for skilled players. Ensure you assess the loft and lie angles to match your playing characteristics; improper angles can affect accuracy and distance. Avoid common mistakes like choosing a set solely based on aesthetics or brand loyalty rather than performance. It's beneficial to test several options to compare the feel and responsiveness on the range before making a decision.

_What to compare:_
- Test the feel and feedback during swings
- Check loft and lie angles for accuracy
- Avoid choosing based on brand or looks
- Compare multiple options for responsiveness
- Consider your skill level before selecting

**raw wedge.** When selecting a raw wedge, consider its loft, bounce, and shaft type, as these elements significantly influence your short-game performance. Raw wedges typically offer better spin control due to their unplated finish, which allows for increased interaction with the ball. Pay attention to the grind options, which can affect how the club performs in different turf conditions. Additionally, evaluating the weight and feel of the club in hand is essential to ensure it suits your swing style and provides the desired feedback.

_What to compare:_
- Check the loft options for versatility
- Assess the bounce angle for course conditions
- Examine the shaft type for feel and control
- Look at grind types for specific play styles
- Ensure the grip size is comfortable for your hands

**gap wedge 50.** When selecting a 50-degree gap wedge, consider your swing speed and style. Slower swing speeds generally benefit from a wedge with a wider sole and more bounce, helping to prevent digging into the turf. Conversely, faster swing profiles might prefer a narrow sole for enhanced maneuverability and precision. Look for options that provide a good balance between forgiveness and control based on your playing conditions. Additionally, factor in your typical short-game scenario to choose a wedge that complements your overall set and maintains consistency in your performance.

_What to compare:_
- Assess your swing speed
- Evaluate sole width and bounce
- Consider your typical lie conditions
- Match loft with existing clubs
- Test for feel and control

**players distance irons.** Choosing the right players distance irons involves understanding your swing and personal preferences. These clubs are designed to blend distance with control, making them suitable for mid to low handicappers. Pay attention to the club's length, loft, and lie angle, as these can significantly affect performance. Additionally, ensure that the grip size feels comfortable in your hands. Try out different shaft materials and flex options to see which best complements your swing speed. Avoid common mistakes such as focusing only on appearance or brand rather than fitting aspects that directly impact your game.

_What to compare:_
- Check the club length for proper fit
- Evaluate loft options for desired distance
- Consider lie angle adjustments for accuracy
