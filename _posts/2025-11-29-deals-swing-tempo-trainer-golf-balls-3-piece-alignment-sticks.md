An impact bag is designed to improve your swing by helping golfers develop proper impact positions while minimizing the risk of injury. Look for a model made from high-quality materials that can withstand repeated strikes without losing shape. Common mistakes include choosing a bag that’s too lightweight or not considering its size relative to your practice space.
