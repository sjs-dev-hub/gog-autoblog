### Gear Insights

#### Drivers by Budget

**high MOI driver** — When shopping for a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver, focus on its ability to offer greater stability and forgiveness on off-center hits, making it ideal for golfers seeking improved accuracy. Key specifications to consider include the club's weight distribution, face technology, and loft options. Common mistakes to avoid are overlooking shaft flexibility, which can affect your swing speed and control, and neglecting to test different grip sizes for comfort.

Examples of high MOI drivers include those with adjustable weights and larger clubhead designs, which enhance stability throughout the swing.

**driver under $300** — When shopping for a driver under $300, focus on finding a balance between performance and value. Look for features like adjustable loft and face angles, which can help customize your shots for improved accuracy and distance. Pay attention to the shaft material—graphite is lighter and can enhance swing speed, while the clubhead size influences forgiveness on off-center hits. 

Common mistakes to avoid include overlooking the importance of a proper fitting and getting too caught up in aesthetics rather than functionality. Consider exploring options like a standard driver or a game-improvement driver, both of which typically offer great performance without breaking the bank.

**draw bias driver** — When shopping for a draw bias driver, it’s essential to understand how this specialized club can enhance your game by helping to correct a slice and promote a right-to-left ball flight. Look for features such as adjustable weights and hosels, which allow for customization in face angle and center of gravity. Common mistakes include overemphasizing flashy designs or ignoring the importance of shaft flexibility and length. 

Consider trying different types, such as a draw bias driver with a larger clubhead for increased forgiveness or one with a more compact design for better control.

Consider the shaft flex, as it impacts your accuracy and distance; options typically include regular, stiff, and extra stiff. Avoid common mistakes like prioritizing aesthetics over functionality or neglecting to test different models before purchase.

#### Training & Tech

**putting mirror** — When shopping for a putting mirror, consider the benefits it offers in improving your alignment and stroke consistency. A quality putting mirror allows you to visualize your setup and ensures your eyes, ball, and target line are perfectly aligned. Look for mirrors that are lightweight and portable, making them easy to use both at home and on the practice green. Key specifications to look for include size—the larger the mirror, the more space you have for alignment practice—and additional features like markings for visual guidance. Avoid the mistake of choosing a poorly reflective surface, as clarity is crucial for effective practice.

A quality launch monitor captures essential data such as ball speed, launch angle, spin rate, and club path, helping you refine your swing and improve your overall performance.

Look for products such as portable launch monitors for on-course use or more advanced, stationary models for in-depth analysis at home.

Look for specifications such as loft, shaft material, and clubhead weight, all of which can influence performance.

Common mistakes include overlooking club length and grip size, which can impact comfort and playability. Always demo different models to find what feels right for your swing.
