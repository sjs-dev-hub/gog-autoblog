New day, new deals. Below is a focused shortlist with **why** each search matters and **what to compare** before you buy. Start with these categories:

### Irons & Wedges

**players distance irons.** Hollow-body or thin-face designs give speed with a compact look. Great for mid-caps chasing ball speed without a shovelly profile.

_What to compare:_
- Loft jacking (watch gapping at the bottom)
- Forgiveness vs topline preference
- Shaft weight/profile match
- Set blending with GI long irons

**gap wedge 50.** A 50° gap wedge bridges modern iron lofts and your 56/60. It tightens yardage gaps and adds a versatile flight around the green.

_What to compare:_
- Loft/lie fit relative to PW & SW
- Bounce/grind for your turf/sand
- Groove sharpness & spin durability
- Shaft match to your irons

**forged irons.** Forged heads emphasize feel and workability. They’re less forgiving but reward center strikes with precise flight windows.

_What to compare:_
- Blade length & sole width (turf interaction)
- Bounce & grind through the set
- Swing-weight consistency
- Chroming/durability of finish

### Drivers by Budget

**driver under $300.** At this price you’re typically choosing last-year heads or value brands. That’s fine—COR is regulated and forgiveness is mostly about head size and weight placement.

_What to compare:_
- Loft (higher loft = easier launch; 10.5–12° fits most)
- Shaft flex & weight (match tempo; slower swings like lighter/softer)
- Adjustability (hosel/weights help tune launch & spin)
- Face angle (slight draw settings help fight a fade)

**best game improvement driver.** High-MOI, draw-biased heads reduce gear-effect sidespin and stabilize mishits. Ideal if fairway-finding beats raw distance for your scores.

_What to compare:_
- Back/heel weighting (helps start line and closure)
- Head size (460cc = max forgiveness)
- Upright lie / draw setting options
- Face tech consistency across the face

**driver under $500.** You’re in current-gen territory with more adjustable weights and tighter manufacturing tolerances. Expect more consistent ball speeds and refined acoustics.

_What to compare:_
- Spin window (mid–low spin if you’re launching high)
- MOI/forgiveness (larger back weight = more stable)
- Stock shaft profile (don’t fear “made-for” if it fits)
- Sound/feel (subjective but confidence matters)

### Training & Tech

**swing analyzer.** Wearable sensors reveal face/path tendencies and tempo ratios. They’re best for practice sessions—not tournament rounds.

_What to compare:_
- Club or glove mount options
- Face/path/tempo metrics reported
- Video sync for feedback
- Subscription cost vs features

**putting mat.** Roll quality matters more than gimmicks. A 9–11 stimp is realistic for home use and helps distance control drills stick.

_What to compare:_
- Mat speed & trueness
- Return track or drop-cup
- Alignment guides for start line
- Storage (roll-up without creases)

**golf launch monitor.** Personal launch monitors are now accurate enough outdoors to guide gapping and equipment choices. Indoors, look for better spin/club tracking.

_What to compare:_
- Measured vs modeled spin/club data
- Outdoor ball-flight capture quality
- Software/app export (CSV/shot library)
- Battery life and tripod/leveling ease
