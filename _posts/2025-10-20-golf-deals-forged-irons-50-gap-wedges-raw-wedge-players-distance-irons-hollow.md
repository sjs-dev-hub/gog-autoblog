Today’s shortlist is built for speed: a bit of context first, then focused filters to scan prices and specs quickly. Today’s quick cuts:

### Irons & Wedges

**Irons & Wedges.** A fast way to compare current options and pricing:

**forged irons.** Forged heads emphasize feedback and flight control. Sole width and bounce must match your turf. Finish durability varies—raw, chrome and PVD wear differently.

_What to compare:_
- Bounce/grind through set
- Finish durability
- Swing-weight consistency

➡️  [See forged irons on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=forged%20irons&tag=guildofgolfde-20)

**gap wedge 50.** Bounce and sole grind should match your turf and delivery. A 50° wedge bridges modern PW-to-SW gaps for tighter yardages. Keep shaft and swing-weight consistent with your irons.

_What to compare:_
- Groove sharpness & durability
- Bounce/grind for turf/sand
- Loft/lie relative to PW & SW
- Shaft match to irons

_What to compare:_
- Loft & gapping

_What to compare:_
- Dozen vs bulk/practice packs
- Dimple stability in wind
- Compression for swing speed
- Urethane vs ionomer cover
