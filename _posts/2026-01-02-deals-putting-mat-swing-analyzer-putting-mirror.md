### FAQ

**Q: What are the benefits of using a putting mat compared to a putting mirror?**

A putting mat provides a realistic surface to practice your stroke indoors, allowing you to work on distance control and consistency. In contrast, a putting mirror helps you analyze your stance and alignment, ensuring that your eyes are over the ball and your stroke is straight. Both tools are valuable for different aspects of putting practice.

**Q: How does a golf launch monitor improve my game compared to using alignment sticks?**

A golf launch monitor offers detailed data on ball flight, swing speed, and launch angle, helping golfers make informed adjustments to their technique. Alignment sticks, on the other hand, are simple yet effective tools for ensuring proper alignment and swing path during practice. While both can enhance performance, the launch monitor provides comprehensive feedback that can lead to a more precise understanding of your game.

**Q: What is the difference between a draw bias driver and a high MOI driver?**

A draw bias driver is designed to help golfers who struggle with slicing the ball by promoting a right-to-left shot shape, effectively encouraging a draw. Conversely, a high MOI (Moment of Inertia) driver offers increased stability and forgiveness on off-center hits, which can help maintain distance and accuracy regardless of swing imperfections. Both drivers serve different needs, catering to specific aspects of a golfer's performance.
