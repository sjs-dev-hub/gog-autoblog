If you want value without doom-scrolling, start here. We explain what to compare, then link straight into high-intent searches. Start with these categories:

### Balls & Accessories

**Balls & Accessories.** Clean jumping-off points with minimal noise:

- Dozen vs bulk/practice packs
- Dimple stability in wind
